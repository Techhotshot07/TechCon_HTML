            History: TechCon, one of the worldâ€™s leading technology conferences, began in 1985 as a small gathering of tech enthusiasts in Silicon Valley. Initially called the "Tech Innovation Expo," it focused on personal computers and featured early tech icons like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.

            During the dot-com boom of the 1990s, TechCon expanded, drawing global attention to innovations like the World Wide Web and e-commerce. By the early 2000s, it became the platform for launching mobile technologies, with the iPhone unveiling in 2007 being a key moment in tech history.
            
            In the 2010s, TechCon went global, showcasing breakthroughs in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. It also introduced an innovation zone for startups, which helped launch many successful ventures.
            
            Today, TechCon attracts over 100,000 attendees, featuring cutting-edge technologies like quantum computing, virtual reality, and sustainable tech. With a legacy of driving technological innovation, TechCon continues to shape the future of the industry.
